# Strategy Guide

Solaris: Command is easy to learn but hard to master. Here are some advanced concepts to help you dominate the galaxy.

## 1. The Front Line
In many RTS games, you move your army as a giant "blob of doom." In Solaris, this is a mistake.
*   **The Wall:** Because of **Zone of Control (ZOC)**, a line of units is impenetrable. An enemy cannot fly *through* your line without stopping.
*   **Spacing:** You don't need a unit in every hex. A unit in every *other* hex creates a continuous wall of ZOC that the enemy cannot bypass.
*   **The Flank:** If the enemy forms a wall, go around it. If they have no wall, fly right past their heavy ships and hit their supply lines.

## 2. Logistics is King
An army marches on its stomach.
*   **Target Supply:** Don't just attack enemy ships. Attack their Stations. If you destroy a forward station, their entire invasion fleet might go **Out of Supply**.
*   **Starvation:** An out-of-supply fleet loses its AP (cannot attack) and eventually its MP (cannot retreat). You can win a war without firing a shot by simply cutting the fuel lines.

## 3. The Initiative Trap
Remember the **Collision Rule**.
*   **Speed Kills:** Light ships (Corvettes) move *before* heavy ships (Battleships) if they try to enter the same hex.
*   **The Pin:** If a Battleship is retreating to a specific hex, you can "pin" it by rushing a Corvette into that hex on the same tick. The Battleship will bounce, take damage, and be stuck in front of your main guns for another hour.

## 4. Diplomacy and Betrayal
You cannot fight everyone at once.
*   **Secure a Border:** Make a Non-Aggression Pact with one neighbor so you can focus all your ships on another.
*   **The Backstab:** But be careful. If you leave your border completely undefended, your "ally" might decide that your undefended planets look very tasty. Trust, but verify.

## 5. Economy Management
*   **Don't Hoard:** Prestige in the bank does nothing. Prestige on the map (as ships) projects power.
*   **Repair Early:** It is cheaper to repair a suppressed step than to replace a destroyed unit. Rotate damaged units to the rear to recover.
