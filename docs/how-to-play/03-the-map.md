# The Map & Terrain

The universe of Solaris is laid out on a hexagonal grid. Not all space is empty; the terrain you fight in can determine the victor.

## Terrain Types

### Empty Space
*   **Movement:** Standard.
*   **Combat:** No modifiers.
*   **Description:** The vast void between stars. Ideal for open maneuvering.

### Asteroid / Debris Fields / Industrial Zones
*   **Movement:** High cost (slower to traverse).
*   **Combat:** **Defense Shift**. Units defending here gain a bonus, simulating entrenchment and using debris for cover.
*   **Description:** Cluttered sectors of space that favor the defender.

> **Strategy Tip:** Park your weaker fleets in Asteroid fields to make them much harder to dislodge.

### Nebulas / Gas Clouds
*   **Movement:** High cost.
*   **Combat:** **Attack Shift**. Units fighting here gain offensive advantages, simulating stealth and ambushes.
*   **Description:** Thick clouds of gas that obscure sensors.

### Radiation Storms
*   **Movement:** Dangerous.
*   **Effect:** Units suffer **Step Suppression** (damage) simply by entering or staying in these hexes.
*   **Description:** Violent cosmic storms that strip shields and irradiate crews. Avoid unless necessary.

### Gravity Wells
*   **Movement:** Impassable.
*   **Description:** Black holes or neutron stars. You cannot enter these hexes.
