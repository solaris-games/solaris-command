# Winning the Game

The goal of Solaris: Command is not just to blow up ships, but to conquer territory.

## Victory Points (VPs)
*   **Source:** You earn VPs by controlling **Planets**.
    * **Capital Planets** award `3` VP and **Planets** award `1` VP per cycle.
*   **Timing:** VPs are awarded at the end of each Cycle.

## Winning
The first player to reach the set **Victory Point Limit** wins the game.

### Tie-Breaks
If multiple players reach the limit at the same time, the winner is decided by:
1.  Total Victory Points.
2.  Total Planets Controlled.
3.  Total Units remaining.
4.  Total Prestige accumulated.

> **Strategy Tip:** It is a valid strategy to play defensively, hold a cluster of high-value planets, and simply outlast your aggressive neighbors until the VP counter ticks over.
