# Introduction

**Solaris: Command** is a game of Grand Strategy, Tactical Depth, and Real-Time Betrayal.

It evolves the slow-burn, real-time strategy genre into a game of operational warfare. Played over the course of weeks, it is a contest of logistics, positioning, and social manipulation.

The galaxy is no longer just a void to be traversed; it is a territory to be conquered, hex by hex.

## War Has Changed
Gone are the days of simple numerical superiority. **Solaris: Command** introduces a rigid **hex-based galaxy map** and a **step-based combat system**.

*   **Hold the Line:** Units are not just numbers; they are formations with distinct health steps. Whittle down enemy fleets through attrition, cut off their retreat, and shatter their cohesion.
*   **The Hex Grid:** Terrain matters. Choke points, nebulas, and open space dictate the flow of battle. Maneuver your fleets to flank the enemy or fortify your borders.
*   **Operational Depth:** Victory requires more than a big fleet. It requires supply lines, reinforcement corridors, and the foresight to know where the enemy will be.

## Diplomacy is the Ultimate Weapon
While the combat has become tactical, the heart of Solaris remains: **the players**.

*   **Real-Time, Long-Form:** Matches play out in real-time over days and weeks. Wake up to check your borders. Message your allies during your lunch break. Plan an invasion before you sleep.
*   **Emergent Narrative:** There are no scripted events. The wars, the alliances, the betrayals, and the dramatic last stands are created entirely by the interactions between you and dozens of other players.
*   **Trust No One:** An ally on your flank is essential for holding the front line—until they decide that your territory looks better than their own.

**Command the grid. Outlast the enemy. Win the war.**
