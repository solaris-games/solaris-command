# Units (Fleets)

In Solaris: Command, a "Unit" represents an entire fleet formation. It is the primary method of projecting power.

## Step Mechanics
A unit is not a single entity but a stack of "Steps". Think of steps as the Hit Points (HP) and combat strength of the fleet.

*   **Active Steps:** Operational ships. These contribute to your combat rolls.
*   **Suppressed Steps:** Damaged, disorganized, or retreating ships. They **do not** contribute to combat and must be recovered via Supply.
*   **Specialist Steps:** Rare, high-value assets (like Artillery or Carriers) that provide unique bonuses to the unit.

## Unit Classes
Different hulls for different roles.

### 1. Screening Ships
*   **Types:** Corvettes, Frigates.
*   **Role:** Scouting, rapid response, capturing undefended points.
*   **Stats:** High Speed (MP), Low Cost, Low Armour.

> **Strategy Tip:** Use Corvettes to probe enemy lines. Losing a cheap corvette to find the enemy's main fleet is a trade worth making.

### 2. Escort & Raiding
*   **Types:** Destroyers, Light Cruisers.
*   **Role:** The backbone of the fleet. Flexible and balanced.
*   **Stats:** Balanced MP, Cost, and Firepower.

### 3. Capital Ships
*   **Types:** Heavy Cruisers, Battlecruisers.
*   **Role:** Line of battle. They can take a hit and dish it out.
*   **Stats:** Heavy Armour, High Firepower, Low Speed.

### 4. Super Capitals
*   **Types:** Battleships, Dreadnaughts.
*   **Role:** Anchor units. The ultimate projection of power.
*   **Stats:** Maximum Firepower and Armour. Very Slow.
