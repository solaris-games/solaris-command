# Glossary

If you are new to hex-and-counter wargames, some of the terminology in Solaris: Command might be unfamiliar. Here is a quick reference guide.

## Key Terms

**AP (Action Points)**
A resource used by units to perform offensive actions, like attacking. Units typically get 1 AP per cycle.

**Counter**
The digital representation of a military unit on the map. In physical board games, these are cardboard squares. In Solaris: Command, they are your fleets.

**Cycle**
The 20 tick _day_ in Solaris: Command. Logistics, income, and repairs happen once per Cycle.

**Hex**
The map is divided into a hexagonal grid. Each "Hex" is a distinct location that can hold one unit (fleet) or structure.

**MP (Movement Points)**
The fuel tank of a unit. MP determines how far a unit can travel in a single Cycle.

**Prestige**
The currency of the game. You earn it from planets and spend it to build units and stations.

**Step**
Units in Solaris are not single ships but fleets. A "Step" is a measure of the fleet's health and size. A unit with all active steps is at full strength; a unit with 1 Step and it is inactive is nearly destroyed.
- **Active Step:** A fully operational portion of the fleet.
- **Suppressed Step:** Damaged or disorganized units that cannot fight until they recover.

**Tick**
The hourly turn. by default this is every hour, the game updates: units move, battles happen, and the map changes.

**ZOC (Zone of Control)**
The area of influence a unit projects into the 6 hexes surrounding it. Moving near enemy units is difficult because of their ZOC.
