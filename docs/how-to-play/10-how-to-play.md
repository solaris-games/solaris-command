# How to Play: Your First Day

Welcome, Commander. This guide will walk you through your first session in Solaris: Command.

## Step 1: Join a Game
When you first enter the lobby, you will see available games.
1.  Select a game.
2.  Pick your color. *Tip: Choose a color that stands out against the background.*
3.  Join the game to be seated in a random slot.

## Step 2: Survey the Field
Once you are in the game, take a moment to orient yourself.
1.  **Find your Capital:** Look for the planet with your color's flag and a star icon. This is your home.
2.  **Identify Neighbors:** Scroll around. Who is near you? Are they friends or potential enemies?
3.  **Check your Resources:** Look at the top bar. You will see your **Prestige** balance.

## Step 3: Deploy New Units
You need to expand your fleet.
1.  **Select a Hex:** Click on an empty hex adjacent to your capital planet (or any planet you own).
2.  **Deploy Menu:** In the fleet panel, look for the "Deploy" options.
3.  **Deploy a new Unit:** Select a unit to deploy. It will spawn with most steps suppressed but in time will recover steps to reach full strength.
    *   *Tip:* Deploy units towards where you plan to expand, but keep weak units safe behind your main fleet.

## Step 4: Issue Orders
It's time to move.
1.  **Select a Unit:** Click on one of your fleet counters. The unit details panel will open.
2.  **Plan Movement:** Click (or tap) on an adjacent hex. A path will be drawn.
    *   *Note:* The game shows you how many ticks it will take to reach that destination.
3.  **Confirm:** Press the **Confirm Move** button.
    *   *Important:* Your unit will not move immediately! It will start moving at the next **Tick** when the game starts.

## Step 5: The Long Game
Now, you wait.
*   Solaris is a "Long Form" game. You don't need to stare at the screen.
*   Your orders are locked in. The server will execute them over the next few ticks.
*   Close the browser. Go about your day. Check back in a few hours to see if your fleet arrived safely or if you need to react to an enemy incursion.

## Step 6: Expand your Empire
Once the game gets going and you have started to expand, you need to build stations to keep your fleet in supply.
1.  **Select a Hex:** Click on a hex you own.
2.  **Build Station:** In the station panel, look for the "Build" options.
3.  **Deploy a Station:** Select a supply station and choose a hex **within range** of your capital planet.
    *   *Tip:* Check your supply network to see where to best place your new station. Keep it safe behind your fleet or risk it being destroyed.

**Good luck, Commander.**
