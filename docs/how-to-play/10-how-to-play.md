# How to Play: Your First Day

Welcome, Commander. This guide will walk you through your first session in Solaris: Command.

## Step 1: Join a Game
When you first enter the lobby, you will see available games.
1.  Select a game.
2.  Choose an available slot.
3.  Pick your color. *Tip: Choose a color that stands out against the background.*

## Step 2: Survey the Field
Once you are in the game, take a moment to orient yourself.
1.  **Find your Capital:** Look for the planet with your color's flag and a star icon. This is your home. If you lose this, you lose the game.
2.  **Identify Neighbors:** Scroll around. Who is near you? Are they friends or potential enemies? Check the player list to see who is online.
3.  **Check your Resources:** Look at the top bar. You will see your **Prestige** balance.

## Step 3: Issue Orders
It's time to move.
1.  **Select a Unit:** Click on one of your fleet counters. The unit details panel will open.
2.  **Plan Movement:** Right-click (or tap) on an adjacent hex. A path will be drawn.
    *   *Note:* The game shows you how many Ticks (hours) it will take to reach that destination.
3.  **Confirm:** Press the **Confirm Move** button.
    *   *Important:* Your unit will not move immediately! It will start moving at the next **Tick** (top of the hour).

## Step 4: Build Infrastructure
You need to expand your reach.
1.  **Select a Planet:** Click on your Capital Planet.
2.  **Build Menu:** In the planet panel, look for the "Build" options.
3.  **Deploy a Station:** Select a supply station and choose a hex within range of your planet.
    *   *Tip:* Build stations towards where you plan to expand, but keep them safe behind your fleet.

## Step 5: The Long Game
Now, you wait.
*   Solaris is a "Long Form" game. You don't need to stare at the screen.
*   Your orders are locked in. The server will execute them at the top of the next hour.
*   Close the browser. Go about your day. Check back in a few hours to see if your fleet arrived safely or if you need to react to an enemy incursion.

**Good luck, Commander.**
