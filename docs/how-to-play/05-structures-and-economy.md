# Structures & Economy

War requires funding. In Solaris, your economy is fueled by **Prestige**, and your logistics are maintained by **Planets** and **Stations**.

## Planets
Planets are the prize.
*   **Economy:** They generate **Prestige** every Cycle.
*   **Logistics:** **Capital Planets** serve as **Root Supply Sources**. They produce infinite supply and cannot be besieged out of supply.
*   **Victory:** Controlling planets earns you Victory Points.

> **Strategy Tip:** Losing your Capital Planet is devastating. It often spells the end of the game for a player. Defend it at all costs.

## Stations
Stations are deployable logistics hubs.
*   **Function:** They extend supply range from Planets into deep space.
*   **Deployment:** When deployed, a station takes time to come online. It provides supply starting the *following* Cycle.

> **Strategy Tip:** Avoid placing stations on the front line. They are fragile. If an enemy captures your station, your entire forward fleet could be cut off from supply!

## Prestige
There is no complex metal or crystal management. The currency is **Prestige**, representing political and military influence.

### Earning Prestige
*   **Income:** Calculated at the end of every Cycle based on owned Planets.
*   **Scrapping:** You can decommission units to refund a small amount of Prestige.

### Spending Prestige
*   **New Units:** Deploy new fleets near your planets.
    *   *Note:* New units spawn with most steps **Suppressed** (representing shakedown cruises). They need time to repair before they are combat-ready.
*   **Reinforcement:** Purchase new steps or specialist steps for existing units. These also arrive Suppressed.
